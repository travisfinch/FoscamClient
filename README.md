FoscamClient
============

I wrote this as a quick way to check up on my sleeping kid from my Nexus 7.

I am using a Foscam FI8918W, but it should work with other models as well.

For now, you must input your camera information as string resources in res/values/strings.xml.

The view supports swiping up/down/left/right to rotate the camera. It seems to work well over a LAN, but lags a bit over the Internet. You can also save snapshots to your device's local storage.
